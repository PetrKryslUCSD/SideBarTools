# Sidebar Tools

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braver/SideBarTools/master/screenshot.png" width="461">

Some useful tools to add to your sidebar context menu and command palette:

- Reveal In Sidebar
- Copy Filename
- Copy Relative Path
- Copy Absolute Path
- Duplicate

If you're missing the "Open With Default" command, consider installing the
[Open in Default Application][5] package.

if you're looking for "Reveal in Finder/Explorer" for directories, [Open in Default Application][5] does that too.

If you're looking for a command to "Move" a file or folder, note that you can use the existing "Rename" command. I accepts paths relative from the file's current location, as well as absolute paths (e.g. `file.txt` -> `../file.txt`). 

This package offers fewer commands than [SidebarEnhancements][1], striking a balance somewhere between the bare minimum 
and going overboard. This has benefits:

- The default context menu isn't replaced, this package just adds some useful 
  new commands.
- It's tiny, fast and reliable.
- We won't [track][2] you. Ever.
